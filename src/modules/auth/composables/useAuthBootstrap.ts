/**
 * Silently restores a session on app boot from the HttpOnly refresh cookie.
 *
 * The access token now lives in memory only (not localStorage), so a hard
 * reload starts with no token even though the refresh cookie may still be
 * valid. Memoized to a single in-flight/resolved promise: main.ts fires it
 * eagerly to start the network round-trip as early as possible, and
 * authGuard awaits the same promise before evaluating `requiresAuth` on the
 * first navigation — awaiting after `app.mount()` isn't enough, since Vue
 * Router's initial navigation (and its guards) starts as soon as
 * `app.use(router)` runs, independent of mount. Never throws — a missing or
 * expired cookie just leaves the user logged out, same as no session.
