This middleware adds security headers to all HTTP responses to protect against
common web vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking, MIME type sniffing, etc.

Headers are configured to match the Caddyfile configuration for consistency.

    Middleware to add security headers to all HTTP responses.

    Adds the following security headers:
    - Content-Security-Policy: Restricts resource loading to prevent XSS
    - X-Frame-Options: Prevents clickjacking attacks
    - X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents MIME type sniffing
    - X-XSS-Protection: Enables XSS filter for legacy browsers
    - Strict-Transport-Security: Forces HTTPS (production only)
    - Referrer-Policy: Controls referrer information
    - Permissions-Policy: Disables sensitive browser features

    CSP policy supports:
    - Google reCaptcha (script-src, frame-src)
    - Sentry error monitoring (connect-src)
    - Web Workers (worker-src blob:)
    - Vue.js inline styles (style-src 'unsafe-inline')
