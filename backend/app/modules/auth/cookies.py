"""HttpOnly cookie helpers for the refresh token.

The refresh token is issued as an HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite=Strict cookie
instead of being returned in the JSON body, so client-side JS (and any XSS)
can never read it. The cookie is scoped to the auth router's own mount path
so it is never attached to unrelated API requests.
